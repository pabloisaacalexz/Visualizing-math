# Visualizing-math
 This repository is devoted to publish scripts where I try to animate or visualize mathematical objects coming from any branch of mathematics, but specially the ones coming from probability theory.
 
 Every script in this repository is open to improvements. If you spot something that could be improved, then you can write to me and make pull requests.
 Thanks to Johnny Godoy who was the first contributor of this repository :).
